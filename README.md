# 5e Spellblock Importer

Do you have a number of homebrewed spells around that you want to use in your foundry 5e game?  Are you tired of manually entering all of them?

5e Spellblock Importer got you covered! You can now copy and paste the standard spell format in the import dialog and "Voil√†!" the new spell item is ready to be used or further customized.

## Acknoledments
